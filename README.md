Objective

The objective of an LED blinking project is to provide a basic demonstration of how to control an output device using a microcontroller, such as an Arduino. This fundamental project helps in understanding several key concepts in electronics and programming. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the objectives
 
 KEY ACTIVITES

 
In an LED blinking project, several key activities and technologies are involved. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Key Activities

1.Component Selection and Preparation


2.Circuit Design and Assembly

3.Design Circuit


Technologies Used:


Microcontroller

Technology: Microcontroller unit (MCU) such as Arduino.
Role: Acts as the central control unit to send signals to the LED based on the program code.

LED (Light Emitting Diode):


Resistor:

Technology: Passive electronic component.
Role: Limits the current passing through the LED to prevent damage.
Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

 Software used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino
Role: Facilitates coding and interaction with the microcontroller.
